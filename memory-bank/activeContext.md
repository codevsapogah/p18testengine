# Active Context: Psychology Test Platform (P18)

## Current Work Focus
The project is currently in a development phase with a focus on implementing secure authentication and test administration features. The recent work has involved migrating from client-side Supabase authentication to a more secure server-side JWT-based authentication system and implementing Row-Level Security (RLS) on all database tables.

## Recent Changes
1. Implemented server-side authentication with JWT tokens
2. Set up HTTP-only cookies for secure token storage
3. Added server-side password verification
4. Developed role-based API authorization
5. Enhanced security by removing direct database access from the client
6. Added server-side data filtering based on user permissions
7. Implemented comprehensive Row-Level Security (RLS) for all tables
8. Updated server code to use service role for bypassing RLS when needed

## Current Status
The application has a functioning:
- Authentication system
- User management interface
- Basic test administration capabilities
- Results storage and retrieval
- Initial data visualization features
- Row-Level Security on all database tables

## Next Steps
1. Test all access patterns to ensure RLS is working correctly
2. Enhance test administration workflows
3. Improve data visualization and analysis tools
4. Implement PDF report generation
5. Add email notification features
6. Develop more comprehensive user management
7. Implement additional security features (as outlined in README)

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Security Enhancements
- Implemented RLS on all database tables
- Updated server code to use both anon and service role clients
- Moving forward with implementation of password hashing with bcrypt
- Planning to add CSRF protection
- Considering implementation of rate limiting

### User Experience
- Evaluating the test-taking interface for improvements
- Considering enhancements to the results visualization
- Planning more intuitive navigation for administrators

### Technical Debt
- Some components need refactoring for better performance
- Authentication logic could be further abstracted
- Test data structure may need optimization

### Open Questions
- What additional test types should be supported?
- How to best implement user feedback mechanisms?
- What additional analytics would be valuable to psychologists?
- How to scale the solution for larger organizations?

## Current Priorities
1. Complete security enhancements
2. Improve test administration experience
3. Enhance reporting capabilities
4. Optimize performance
5. Add documentation
