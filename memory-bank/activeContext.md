# Active Context: Psychology Test Platform (P18)

## Current Work Focus
The project is currently in a development phase with a focus on implementing secure authentication and test administration features. The recent work has involved migrating from client-side Supabase authentication to a more secure server-side JWT-based authentication system and implementing Row-Level Security (RLS) on all database tables.

## Recent Changes
1. Implemented server-side authentication with JWT tokens
2. Set up HTTP-only cookies for secure token storage
3. Added server-side password verification
4. Developed role-based API authorization
5. Enhanced security by removing direct database access from the client
6. Added server-side data filtering based on user permissions
7. Implemented comprehensive Row-Level Security (RLS) for all tables
8. Updated server code to use service role for bypassing RLS when needed

## Current Status
The application has a functioning:
- Authentication system
- User management interface
- Basic test administration capabilities
- Results storage and retrieval
- Initial data visualization features
- Row-Level Security on all database tables

## Next Steps
1. Test all access patterns to ensure RLS is working correctly
2. Enhance test administration workflows
3. Improve data visualization and analysis tools
4. Implement PDF report generation
5. Add email notification features
6. Develop more comprehensive user management
7. Implement additional security features (as outlined in README)

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Security Enhancements
- Implemented RLS on all database tables
- Updated server code to use both anon and service role clients
- Moving forward with implementation of password hashing with bcrypt
- Planning to add CSRF protection
- Considering implementation of rate limiting

### User Experience
- Evaluating the test-taking interface for improvements
- Considering enhancements to the results visualization
- Planning more intuitive navigation for administrators

### Technical Debt
- Some components need refactoring for better performance
- Authentication logic could be further abstracted
- Test data structure may need optimization

### Open Questions
- What additional test types should be supported?
- How to best implement user feedback mechanisms?
- What additional analytics would be valuable to psychologists?
- How to scale the solution for larger organizations?

## Current Priorities
1. Complete security enhancements
2. Improve test administration experience
3. Enhance reporting capabilities
4. Optimize performance
5. Add documentation

## Current Focus: Results Page Styling

### Button Styles Location
The results page button styles are defined in multiple components:

1. Main Header Section (`ResultsPage.jsx`):
```jsx
<div className="grid gap-3 grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2">
  {/* View toggle buttons */}
  <div className="flex rounded-lg overflow-hidden bg-white/20 shadow-inner">
    <button
      onClick={() => setCurrentViewState('list')}
      className={`py-2.5 px-4 text-sm font-medium flex-1 transition-colors ${
        currentViewState === 'list' 
          ? 'bg-white text-[rgb(107, 70, 193)]' 
          : 'text-white hover:bg-white/10'
      }`}
      style={{ color: currentViewState === 'list' ? 'rgb(107, 70, 193)' : 'white' }}
    >
      {translations.listView[language]}
    </button>
    {/* ... */}
  </div>
  
  {/* Download PDF button */}
  <button
    onClick={handleDownloadPDF}
    className="py-2.5 px-4 bg-white rounded-lg text-sm font-medium hover:bg-gray-100 transition-colors flex items-center justify-center shadow-sm text-[rgb(107, 70, 193)]"
    style={{ color: 'rgb(107, 70, 193)' }}
  >
    {/* ... */}
  </button>
</div>
```

2. Call to Action Section:
```jsx
<div className="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-600 to-blue-700 rounded-lg shadow-md p-4 sm:p-6 text-white mb-8">
  <div className="flex justify-center">
    <a
      href={getWhatsAppLink()}
      className="bg-white text-[rgb(37, 99, 235)] px-4 py-2 rounded-full font-medium text-sm sm:text-base hover:bg-gray-50 transition-colors shadow-md hover:shadow-lg transform hover:scale-105 transition-all duration-200"
      style={{ color: 'rgb(37, 99, 235)' }}
    >
      {/* ... */}
    </a>
  </div>
</div>
```

### Button Text Color Fix
Added explicit inline styles to all buttons to ensure text colors are correctly displayed. The issue was that in some browsers/environments, the Tailwind text color classes weren't being applied properly, resulting in white text on white backgrounds.

#### Fixed Issues:
- Added `style={{ color: currentViewState === 'list' ? 'rgb(107, 70, 193)' : 'white' }}` to list/grid toggle buttons
- Added `style={{ color: 'rgb(107, 70, 193)' }}` to Download PDF button
- Added `style={{ color: 'rgb(37, 99, 235)' }}` to Call to Action button

IMPORTANT: Always use both className AND style for text colors on buttons to ensure proper rendering across all environments.

### Color Reference
- Purple background: `rgb(107, 70, 193)`
- Blue gradient: `from-blue-600 to-blue-700`
- Blue text on white button: `rgb(37, 99, 235)`

### Recent Changes
- Updated container width to `max-w-5xl`
- Fixed button text colors to match design
- Ensured consistent spacing and alignment

### Next Steps
1. Verify all button text colors are correctly applied
2. Test responsive behavior on different screen sizes
3. Document any additional style patterns found

### Active Decisions
- Using RGB color values for consistency
- Maintaining separate color definitions for different button states
- Using Tailwind classes for layout and basic styling
- Using inline RGB colors for specific brand colors
