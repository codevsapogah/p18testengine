# Progress: Psychology Test Platform (P18)

## What Works

### Authentication
- ✅ Server-side JWT authentication
- ✅ HTTP-only cookie storage
- ✅ Login/logout functionality
- ✅ Role-based access control
- ✅ Password verification on server

### User Management
- ✅ User creation
- ✅ User role assignment
- ✅ Basic user profile management
- ✅ User listing with filtering

### Test Administration
- ✅ Basic test assignment
- ✅ Test delivery to clients
- ✅ Test completion and submission
- ✅ Results storage

### Data Visualization
- ✅ Basic charts for test results
- ✅ Individual test result viewing
- ✅ Simple comparative analytics

### Security
- ✅ Server-side data filtering
- ✅ No direct database access from client
- ✅ Protected API endpoints
- ✅ Environment-specific configurations
- ✅ Row-Level Security (RLS) on all tables
- ✅ Service role bypass for server operations

## What's Left to Build

### Authentication Enhancements
- ❌ Password hashing with bcrypt
- ❌ CSRF protection
- ❌ Two-factor authentication
- ❌ Rate limiting for login attempts

### User Management Enhancements
- ❌ Advanced user filtering
- ❌ Bulk user operations
- ❌ User activity logging
- ❌ User preference settings

### Test Administration Enhancements
- ❌ Advanced test scheduling
- ❌ Custom test creation
- ❌ Test sequence management
- ❌ Conditional test paths

### Reporting
- ❌ PDF report generation
- ❌ Email delivery of reports
- ❌ Customizable report templates
- ❌ Batch reporting

### Analytics
- ❌ Advanced statistical analysis
- ❌ Comparative group analytics
- ❌ Trend analysis over time
- ❌ Data export capabilities

### Infrastructure
- ❌ Automated testing suite
- ❌ Comprehensive error handling
- ❌ Performance optimizations
- ❌ Advanced logging
- ❌ RLS access pattern testing

## Current Status

The application is in a working state with core functionality implemented. The recent migration to server-side authentication has improved security significantly, and the implementation of Row-Level Security (RLS) has further enhanced data protection. The platform can be used for basic psychological test administration and result analysis, but lacks some advanced features and refinements.

## Known Issues

1. Some UI components need responsive design improvements
2. Authentication token refresh mechanism needs optimization
3. Form validation requires enhancement in several areas
4. Test results visualization needs additional chart types
5. Performance can be slow with large datasets
6. Error handling is inconsistent across the application
7. RLS policies need comprehensive testing across all access patterns

## Next Development Iterations

### Short-term (Current Sprint)
- Test RLS implementation across all user roles
- Implement password hashing with bcrypt
- Add basic PDF report generation
- Improve responsive design of key components
- Enhance error handling in critical paths

### Medium-term (Next 2-3 Sprints)
- Implement CSRF protection
- Add email notification system
- Develop advanced test administration features
- Create comprehensive reporting system

### Long-term (Future Roadmap)
- Add two-factor authentication
- Implement advanced analytics
- Develop custom test creation tools
- Build integration capabilities with other systems
